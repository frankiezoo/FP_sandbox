A sandbox for single magnet single superconductor flux pinning dynamics.

All code is contained in four files: FP_sandbox. fig, FP_sanbox.m, FP_sandbox_graphics.m, and single_magnet_single_superconductor.slx. You must have MATLAB on your computer to run this sandbox.

To run this sandbox, download all four files and place them in your current MATLAB directory. run FP_sandbox fill in all physical parameters press different buttons to show different graphics Buttons are organized in chronological order.
